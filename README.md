# This is where SETS Platform be built with NextJS

# Rules
1. To protect "master" branch, which is where our main product lies. Please commits your code only to "develop" branch. Project Manager will be the one who merges "develop" branch to "master" branch.
2. Remember to comment code clearly so that eventhough who don't learn NextJS can understand the structure of code.
